# HIDEN's personal website
This the source code to my personal website, which you can find at https://hiden.pw.

To run, install the requirements using pip: `pip install -r requirements .txt`. If you don't have pip, install it from your distibution's package manager assuming you're running Linux. The Windows version of Python should come with pip installed by default.

After that, run the site with "python runserver.py".

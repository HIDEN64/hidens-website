<h1>10-23-2021</h1>
<p>There's a new page, alongside facts in the footer (totally original idea that I totally didn't steal from HM). No news, because I'm dropping that. This section is only for website and project updates from now on. 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h1>10-5-2021</h1>
<p>The redesign plan has been shelved. Instead, I'll opt for updating the current design. In today's news, Windows 11 launched to somewhat mixed reviews. I've already installed it on my system, and it runs better than Windows 10 despite my system not meeting the minimum requirements. A guide I've written to bypass the requirements can be accessed <a href="https://twitter.com/epictaco302/status/1445471433400930304?s=20">here.</a> This should retain the ability to do an in-place upgrade, as well as Windows Update functionality. Also, Android 12 launched as well.
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;</p>
 
<h1>8-9-2021</h1>
<p>I've added some prelimnary parts of the MAJOR redesign that I was planning for a while. For today's news, Apple is now selling refurbished iPad Pro models starting at $609 USD, Apple is apparently working on YET another update to iOS 14, which is iOS 14.8, despite iOS 15 being released in the coming months, and Xbox Cloud Gaming is in beta for PC users of Game Pass Ultimate.

<h1>8-6-2021</h1>
<p>tacobot is BACK baby! I've also added a new link to the homepage. In today's news, Nintendo is having a sale on some of it's multiplayer focused games, such as Splatoon 2, Super Mario Party, and more, you can now buy AMD Ryzen 5000 series APUs with an integrated GPU, and ASUS pushes a BIOS update to some of their motherboards, so that the built-in TPM is now enabled by default, so upgrading to Windows 11 with those boards won't be as much as a headache.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h1>7-27-2021</h1>
<p>I removed mentions of GoodbyeGalaxy. In today's news, 6 US states bans the sale of prebuilt gaming PCs due to new energy consumption laws in place. Personally, I think they should've banned cryptomining instead because that drains MUCH more energy. Also, Jim Browning, known for his scambaiting on YouTube, had his channel deleted due to him being scammed. A very sad case of irony indeed.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h1>7-18-2021</h1>
<p>New major changes as well as minor changes to the website. The background has been changed, there is now a footer, hyperlinks now have their own colors, and we also have been squashing some bugs and making some slight tweaks visually.  In other news, Amazon got Apple to remove an app from the app store that spots out fake reviews.

<h1>7-11-2021</h1>
<p>Happy slurpee day! To celebrate, I made a major internal change to most of the webpages here. Most of the code was unorganized and bloated... until today! Check out the much cleaner code, will ya?

<h1>6-26-2021</h1>
<p>This website has moved to a new home. It is now being hosted on GitHub Pages instead of XPCat's secondary laptop.
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h1>6-22-2021</h1>
<p>The website is now open source. You can grab the source code <a href="https://github.com/epictaco302/epictacos-website">here</a>. I am also planning to do a redesign of the site in the future. 
I also cleaned up the index page a bit.<br>

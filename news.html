<br>
<h1>12-26-2021</h1>
<p>
<li>The footer now appears on every page.</li>
<br>
<li>A rework of the site to utlitze jinja (and maybe Bootstrap 5?) <br> is planned to happen sometime into Q1 2022.</li>
<br>
<li>The news page was heavily reworked.</li>
<br>
<li>Tables and site logos have been heavily reworked to utilize CSS instead of the archaic in-HTML style definitions.</li>
<br>
<li>Many other visual tweaks have been added.<li>
<br>
<li>The site logo has been updated, as this isn't really a "90s-designed site" anymore.</li>

<br>
<br>
</p>

<h1>12-25-2021</h1>
<p>
<li>Merry Christmas! Our gift for this year is the revival of the website after ~1 month of letting it rot. We're sorry about that.</li>
<br>
<li>Footer facts have also been removed as they are pretty bloaty and unessecary.</li>
<br>
<li>TacoBot has been rebranded as Epiphany and is now hosted on GitLab.</li>
<br>
<li>This was unveiled while the website was down, but we're introducing a new project. Horizon: Multiple chat protocols implemented as frontends running on a single generic backend, and allowing them to communicate with one another. Based on <a href="https://www.escargot.chat">Escargot</a> and keeping the original goal going.</li>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<h1>11-05-2021</h1>
<p>
<li>This website and Pepsi Supremacy have merged. It's more efficent and causes less confusion that way.</li>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<h1>10-30-2021</h1>
<p>
<li>Happy (early) Halloween! Nothing huge today, just moving around and removing some things; fixing issues with the fonts, removing the RetroSite ad, removing the license (since it's pointless anyway), changing up some text, removing mentions of HM/XPCat besides one footer fact, moving unused images to old stuff, etc. Minor bug fixes too.</li>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<br>
<br>
<h1>10-23-2021</h1>
<p>
<li>There's a new page (links). No outside news, because I'm dropping that. This section is only for website and project updates from now on. 
<br>
<br>
</p>

<h1>10-5-2021</h1>
<p>
<li>The redesign plan has been shelved. Instead, I'll opt for updating the current design.</li>
<br>
<br>
</p>
 
<h1>8-9-2021</h1>
<p>
<li>I've added some prelimnary parts of the redesign that I was planning for a while.</li>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<h1>8-6-2021</h1>
<p>
<li>TacoBot is back (See above). I've also added a new link to the homepage.</li>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<h1>7-18-2021</h1>
<p>
<li>New major changes as well as minor changes to the website. <br> The background has been changed, there is now a footer, hyperlinks now have their own colors, <br> and I also have been squashing some bugs and making some slight tweaks visually.</li>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<h1>7-11-2021</h1>
<p>
<li>Happy slurpee day! To celebrate, I made a major internal change to most of the webpages here. Most of the code was unorganized and bloated... until today!</li>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>


<h1>6-26-2021</h1>
<p>
<li>This website has moved to a new home. It is now being hosted on GitHub Pages instead of HM's secondary laptop.</li>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<h1>6-22-2021</h1>
<p>
<li>The website is now open source. You can grab the source code <a href="https://github.com/epictaco302/epictacos-website">here</a>. I am also planning to do a redesign of the site in the future.</li>
<li>I also cleaned up the index page a bit.</li>
<br>
<br>
<a href="index.html">Back to the home page</a>

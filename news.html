<h1>7-18-2021</h1>
<p>New major changes as well as minor changes to the website. The background has been changed, there is now a footer, hyperlinks now have their own colors, and we also have been squashing some bugs and making some slight tweaks visually.  In other news, Amazon got Apple to remove an app from the app store that spots out fake reviews.

<p>The website is now open source. You can grab the source code <a href="https://github.com/epictaco302/epictacos-website">here</a>. I am also planning to do a redesign of the site in the future. 
I also cleaned up the index page a bit.<br>

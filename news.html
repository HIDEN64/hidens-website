<p>tacobot is BACK baby! I've also added a new link to the homepage. In today's news, Nintendo is having a sale on some of it's multiplayer focused games, such as Splatoon 2, Super Mario Party, and more, you can now buy AMD Ryzen 5000 series APUs with an integrated GPU, and ASUS pushes a BIOS update to some of their motherboards, so that the built-in TPM is now enabled by default, so upgrading to Windows 11 with those boards won't be as much as a headache.<br>

<p>We removed mentions of GoodbyeGalaxy in light of him being revealed to be a pedophile. In today's news, 6 US states bans the sale of prebuilt gaming PCs due to new energy consumption laws in place. Personally, I think they should've banned cryptomining instead because that drains MUCH more energy. Also, Jim Browning, known for his scambaiting on YouTube, had his channel deleted due to him being scammed. A very sad case of irony indeed.<br>

<h1>7-18-2021</h1>
<p>New major changes as well as minor changes to the website. The background has been changed, there is now a footer, hyperlinks now have their own colors, and we also have been squashing some bugs and making some slight tweaks visually.  In other news, Amazon got Apple to remove an app from the app store that spots out fake reviews.

<h1>6-22-2021</h1>
<p>The website is now open source. You can grab the source code <a href="https://github.com/epictaco302/epictacos-website">here</a>. I am also planning to do a redesign of the site in the future. 
I also cleaned up the index page a bit.<br>

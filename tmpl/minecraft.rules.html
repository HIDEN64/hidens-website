<h1>Rules:</h1><br><br><br>

<h2>GENERAL RULES</h2><br>
<li class=mcsrvrule>Do not use hacks, cheats, exploits, or anything else that gains an unfair advantage over other players.</li><br><br>
<li class=mcsrvrule>Don't purposefully lag the server (i.e: DDoS). Again, this should be common sense.</li><br><br>
<li class=mcsrvrule>Ignore trolls and idiots. Quitely report them to an operator to get them out painlessly.</li><br><br><br><br>

<h2>CHAT RULES</h2><br>
<li class=mcsrvrule>Anyone from any origin is allowed here. Being a bigot (i.e: homophobia, transphobia, racism, sexism, xenophobia, etc) and using slurs that target said groups of people will result in a mute, and a ban if it's persistent.</li><br><br>
<li class=mcsrvrule>Don't spam in the chat. Apparently this isn't common sense.</li><br><br>
<li class=mcsrvrule>Do not send malware, porn site links, or phishing site links in the chat.</li><br><br>
<li class=mcsrvrule>If discussing possibly controversial subjects such as politics and religion, keep it civil.</li><br><br>
<li class=mcsrvrule>Out of respect for all that have been hurt and/or killed, I ask you please do not discuss the Ukrainian-Russian war.</li><br><br>

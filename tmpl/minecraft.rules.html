<h1>Rules:</h1><br>

<h3>GENERAL RULES</h3><br>
<li class=mcsrvrule>Do not use hacks, cheats, exploits, or anything else that gains an unfair advantage over other players.</li><br><br>
<li class=mcsrvrule>Don't purposefully lag the server (i.e: DDoS). Again, this should be common sense.</li><br><br>
<li class=mcsrvrule>Ignore trolls and idiots. Quitely report them to an operator to get them out painlessly.</li><br><br><br><br>

<h3>CHAT RULES</h3><br>
<li class=mcsrvrule>Anyone from any origin is allowed here. Being a bigot (i.e: homophobia, transphobia, racism, sexism, xenophobia, etc) and using slurs that target said groups of people will result in a mute, and a ban if it's persistent.</li><br><br>
<li class=mcsrvrule>Don't spam in the chat. Apparently this isn't common sense.</li><br><br>
<li class=mcsrvrule>Do not send malware, porn site links, or phishing site links in the chat.</li><br><br>
<li class=mcsrvrule>If discussing possibly controversial subjects such as politics and religion, keep it civil. <!--(why would anyone do this through minecraft)--></li><br><br>
